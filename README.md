# This sample demonstrates : The Four Pillars of Object Oriented Programming</br>
# Encapsulation</br>
     Encapsulation is accomplished when each object maintains a private state, inside a class.</br>
     Other objects can not access this state directly, instead, they can only invoke a list of public functions.</br>
     The object manages its own state via these functions and no other class can alter it unless explicitly allowed.</br>
     In order to communicate with the object, you will need to utilize the methods provided.</br>
# Abstraction</br>
      Abstraction is an extension of encapsulation. It is the process of selecting data from a larger pool to show only the relevant details to the object.</br>
# Inheritance
      Inheritance is the ability of one object to acquire some/all properties of another object.</br>
# Polymorphism
      Polymorphism gives us a way to use a class exactly like its parent so there is no confusion with mixing types.</br>
      This being said, each child sub-class keeps its own functions/methods as they are.</br>
